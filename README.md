[Undraw graphics](https://undraw.co)

This is a JS exported collection of links pointing to undraw hosted images.

Example:

```javascript
{
  coding: 'https://42f2671d685f51e10fc6-b9fcecea3e50b3b59bdc28dead054ebc.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/illustrations/coding_6mjf.svg',
  selfieTime: 'https://42f2671d685f51e10fc6-b9fcecea3e50b3b59bdc28dead054ebc.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/illustrations/selfie_time_cws4.svg',
  webDevices: 'https://42f2671d685f51e10fc6-b9fcecea3e50b3b59bdc28dead054ebc.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/illustrations/web_devices_ad58.svg',
  eatingTogether: 'https://42f2671d685f51e10fc6-b9fcecea3e50b3b59bdc28dead054ebc.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/illustrations/eating_together_tjhx.svg',
  ...
}
```

Because undraw doesn't allow me to publish the images directly this only serves as a pointer to the graphics, while you could combine this module with a [remote-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/roneyrao/remote-webpack-plugin) that fetches the images at build time to maintain a legal usage of the graphics and a developer-friendly experience
